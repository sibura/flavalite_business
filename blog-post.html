        <p class="lead">14 September 2018 The Internet has made the world a global village. South Africa is a gateway to the African continent. Our country is wealthy with culture and diversity. It is a one of the 54 countries collectively composing Africa. The currency used in South Africa is the Rand (ZAR). The black middle class is an asset.</p>

        <p>There are 12 official South Africa languages, including sign language, as of 2018. English and Zulu are the dominant out of the South African languages. Our country is economically established and is a developing country. There is a wealth of mineral resources. South Africa has sophisticated legal and financial services. There are growing exporting opportunities and there are free consultations for companies who are keen to explore these opportunities from the Department of International Relations and Co-operations (DIRCO, 2018) led by Honourable Minister Lindiwe Sisulu. The British High Commission Office in Pretoria is available to assist UK Citizens in South Africa regarding most business advice. It is also wise to join the British Chamber of Business in South based in Johannesburg and Cape Town.</p>
          <!-- Image1 macbook -->
        <p>There are favourable agreements for business people forged by Heads of State between South Africa and the UK that have been mutually beneficial (British Chamber of Business in South Africa, 2018; Department of International Trade, 2015). There are banks that allow banking in both South Africa and the UK, such as Investec. There are well known UK companies that have invested in South Africa such as: British Telecoms, British Petroleum, British Airways, BAE Systems and many more. These companies had to grapple with the preferential procurement newly enacted South African laws such as being compliant to the BBBEE legislation or complying with ‘alternative agreements with South African Governments’ of upskilling South African companies and communities in a measurable manner.</p>


        <p>On the technical side, South Africa is challenged with digital divide. Some parts have sophisticated technology infrastructure and other parts are plagued by insufficient technology infrastructure. There is an opportunity to strategically add value in the fourth industrial revolution in parallel with the third industrial revolution that has not made much headway in Africa, in a sustainable manner. As much as manufacturing is migrating to a digital landscape the physical aspects of manufacturing are still necessary. The fourth industrial revolution is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, collectively referred to as cyber-physical systems (Kariuki, 2018; Thotsejane, 2018a). South African capital markets are top rated in the world, making it easy to raise financing. South Africa has a strong services sector. The government has set up an infrastructure upgrade programme to reduce infrastructure problems in Telecommunications, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), energy, transport and water (Thotsejane, 2018a; Department of International Trade, 2015). There is still a persistent gap of a sustainable national holistic technology strategy that communicated and should be implemented by both the public and private sectors due to shortage of technology expertise in SA. There are other opportunities of making a difference in upskilling Africa’s human capital formally and informally (yet methodologically with structure) using AI, work integrated learning, mentorship, job shadowing and other practical methods.</p>

        <p>The sustainable national holistic technology strategy may be led by the Honourable Minister of Science and Technology’s office and the Minister may open the Strategic Team to experts in South Africa, Africa and the rest of the world and then prioritise it. An end-to-end national ICT strategy that takes cognisance of every sector and global trends usually fights for a seat at the priority table in the midst of food shortage, poor healthcare, Bantu education remnants and shortage of homes in South Africa. May we realise that these elements are inclusive and may happen in parallel than being mutually exclusive. With the Internet being a basic human right, and data has become currency; the digital revolution shows no signs of slowing down. Thotsejane (2018b) shared with an audience from South Africa and Sweden that Big data and digital analytics are known as big data analytics (BDA), a term that is budding to be understood as a process of analyzing big volumes of structured and unstructured data collated from a number of various channels including domains, in order to add value to business intelligence for faster profit-making decision making or producing sustainable suggestions. She further defined Artificial Intelligence (AI) as emerging to be understood as a number of statistical methods applied to large data sets. Using AI, machines can do big data analytics work continuously in the background and identify potential issues. The “principle of complementarity” suggests that AI and human expert judgment reinforce each other when they are properly coordinated; therefore, it is important to highlight for the African human capital that jobs do not necessarily have to be lost, especially when the workforce embraces life-long learning (Thotsejane, 2018b).</p>

        <p>Some start-up’s such as FlavaLite Innovations and F.L.I. Global enable organisations (public and private) to understand their Audience through Analytics, especially the geographic areas in which they engage with an organisation’s site. The critical insights reported by these start-ups empower Leaders and Decision Makers in organisations regarding the next country or town where they should expand to, based on tangible information from Geo-Location reports compiled from Analytics tools. Reports can be automated and scheduled for Leaders and Decision Makers. South Africans are creating world class innovations and SA is alive with opportunities.</p>
